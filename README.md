## INSTRUCTIONS

Get the template on links section and click File -> Make a copy and edit that copy.

Put a spotify song link on row D, it will get automatically group's name (row A) and song's name (row B). 

The year is on your own, you can open url on row E to get help from discogs.com to help you get song's year or use google.

As a complement, you can use the buzzer app to synchronize with several mobile phones to determine who guesses first.
