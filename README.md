## INSTRUCTIONS WITH SPOTLISTR PROVIDER | work with Playlist links 
1. **Open the template with Spotlistr** from the links above in Google Drive.
2. Click **File → Make a Copy** to create an editable version of the template.
3. Open [SPOTLISTR](https://www.spotlistr.com/export/spotify-playlist) click **Login With Spotify To Begin!**. Next, put the link of the playlist on the checkbox and click **Search**.

6. Select all the data and click **Data -> Split text to column** and edit **Separator: detect automatically** to **Custom** and use **|** as a custom separator
7. Next, you should check dates of songs. You need to add month and date even if is fake, because it doesn't work with only a year... something like yyyy-1-1 with the correct year. 
8. Spotify is **not reliable** to check on release dates, check with discogs.com or google to improve date accuracy.
9. Print and Use any QR reader available on your phone to scan the QR codes generated in the sheet named "Print - DONT TOUCH".
#### WARNINGS
- If dates shows as 1905, you need to add a month and a day to the release date column.

- **Do not delete or add rows**. Always add new data starting from the last row, or you risk breaking the formulas.
